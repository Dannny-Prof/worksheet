   <p> <strong> Hello Everyone...</p>
    <p>  My name is Daniel, I am an undergraduate studying Cyber Security/ welfare. I currently have new knowledge on various branches of Computer Science and I'm working towards polishing them along side my main study. 
    </strong></p>
    <p>Although I aspire to venture and dominate the Tech world in years to come, I am amongst other things; A Writer, A Baller, An Entrepreneur and A Bad Ass Business man. </p>
      <p>I have working experience on both Goverment and Private grounds. I am observant, quiet, competent and have a unkillable desire to discover and learn new things.  </p>
      <p>In short, <em><b> I'm a King.</b></em></p>
